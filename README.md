## Attack and Defense against a SQL injection Vulnerable Web Application

- This is our final term project in Network and System Managing class. This project is about deploying 2 websites on a web server and configuring a local DNS server to resolve the local hostname, plus these 2 websites have remote database access. To demonstration the action of these services we use NAT network of virtual machines.
